# Insights from Dashboards
  Attrition Rate: The organization experiences a high overall attrition rate of 50.21%.
  
  Departmental Trends: Research & Development has the highest attrition rate (51.21%), while Human Resources has one of the 
  lowest.
  
  Work-Life Balance: Employees in roles like Research Scientist and Developer report better work-life balance, correlating 
  to lower attrition in these categories.
  
  Income and Attrition: Employees in the low-income category tend to have a slightly higher attrition rate.
  
  Promotion Impact: Employees who havenâ€™t been promoted in over 10 years show higher attrition rates compared to those 
  promoted more recently.
# Conclusion
The HR-Attrition Dashboard provides actionable insights into the key factors influencing employee attrition. By focusing on departments and roles with the highest attrition rates and addressing issues like promotion delays and income disparities, the organization can improve retention and create a more satisfied workforce. This project demonstrates how integrating tools like Excel, SQL, Tableau, and Power BI can drive data-driven decisions.
